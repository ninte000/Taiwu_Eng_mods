# Taiwu_Eng_mod

**Introduction**

The Eng mod currently rely heavily on BaseResourceMod, sideloading is possible but "propALLText.txt" will not function, resulting in some untranslated UI.

To install the English Mod, first install the latest *"BaseResourceMod"* through *"Unity Mod Mananger 0.12.2"*.
Then put the data and texture folders directly into the game directory.



**Update History**

Updated for v0.2.6.19
Updated for v0.2.6.18




**To-Do-List**

1. Initial translation and audit of flavor texts

2. Rework the skill/item names, so that they fits into the UI better
   This is especially the case during casting of the skills, only half of the skill name is present in the casting bar. Which is not always informative, when the enemy has multiple skills that share similar names.
   
3. Translation of Tutorial text boxes.
   These are not present in the text files. According to one of the devs Ju, this is prefabs, which gets cloned nto the scenes when you playing teaching.
   It is unclear how we should mod it, it would be great if anyone can help.
   
4. Translation of various icons
   4.1 Certain icons are in texture\, which are loadable with BaseResourceMod, these just need spending time editing
   4.2 Other icons are not currectly supported by BaseResourceMod, an important example is sactx-2048x1024-Crunch-ActorPageIcon-61efc809, 
       which includes all the tabs in the UI, that would help English players if translated.
       Again it is unclear how to tackle these, it would be greatful if anyone could help.
